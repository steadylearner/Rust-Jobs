### How to publish a job opening

Submit an [issue](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Jobs/issuesnew) and, in the title of that _issue_, let others know the name of the city between square brackets followed by the name of the job openings.

Exemple: `[New York] Rust Blockchain Developer`

Include _labels_ mentioning the desired experience level and the contract conditions.

**Note**: We won't accept the job openings without the name of a contractor company. It is not allowed to republish the same job openings without specific reason.

#### Important

To avoid the candidates send the res√∫me to the job oepnings already filled, we implore the recruiters to close the issue when it is not available anymore.
